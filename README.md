The following research aims, the characterization of a rock mass with late rock blasting at the mine &lt;&lt;El gran porvenir del LÃ­bano>>. Therein, it is intended setting out in clear and simple, all processes involving the study of the physical principles of mechanics, using an extraction system by drilling and blasting of rocks. Ultimately, and from research, precise knowledge of ground conditions for a possible assertive management of spaces known how you also get: Mineral reserves, so, this study contributes to research treatment for engineering and variants.
